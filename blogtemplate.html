                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-5">Captaincy wins matches and can lose them, but it can do more than that; it can make or mar the game, not only in terms of a win but in general satisfaction and enjoyment which playing cricket should bring and which constitutes the real reason for playing it. 
<br>The method of selection of the Captain or nomination varies within wide limits, but there seems little to be said for the system whereby the senior player automatically succeeds to office. Experience is certainly an asset; so is personal prowess; but neither is so important as character, personality, enthusiasm, and the capacity to think and learn about the game. The sovereign virtue in a Captain is unselfishness; <strong>HE MUST PUT OTHERS BEFORE HIMSELF 
</strong><br><br>Most Captains have a senior adviser or coach and he should miss no opportunity to avail himself of much greater experience. He will be wise to recognise that in seeking guidance and support he will in no sense be impairing his own authority or prestige. The adviser/coach will welcome a discussion with the Captain before and after each match and a tactical talk before the next one; sometimes the whole XI will share in these. No Captain can possibly anticipate all the demands that will be made on him, and the best are those who realise from the start how much they have to learn. 
<br>The Captain must be leader of men, he must study each one of his team mates as individuals, get to know their temperaments and how best to handle them both on and off the field. Nothing destroys morale more than a lack of communication between Captain and Players. When there are changes to be made in the team he must keep team members fully informed, always ready with a kind word for those left out or omitted through injury, and a word of encouragement to the replacements. This builds team spirit - the key to success! Discipline is essential in any cricket team; ideally it should stem from the Captain downwards. The Captain must also see his team is well turned out, both as regards dress and equipment. Neglected boots may result in injury or lose the match. 
<br><br>He must be an optimist and inspire optimism in his side; he must show confidence in them in order they may feel confidence in him; by personality and example he will get the best out of them. A Captain must know the Laws of Cricket and the 'Notes' that accompany them - furthermore, he must study carefully the Rules and Playing Conditions as set by the organising committee or the board from time to time and for the different tournaments; this means some quite hard work. Few Players really know them. 
<br><br>The Captain must also be courteous. Umpires, Scorers, Groundsmen and match management will not fail to appreciate a word of thanks at the end of the Match from the Captain. He must be punctual and he must be seen as such. 
<br><br>Before the Captain takes the field, he must have a clear idea in his head of his general tactical plan. At all costs he must try to retain the initiative and dictate to the batsman and not be dictated to. He will never allow irresponsible appeals from fielders who are not in a position to see; collective appealing' and gesticulations are contrary to the spirit of the game and the Captain should strongly discourage them. Perhaps the hallmark of a good tactical Captain is his ability to keep an open mind and as the game evolves to be flexible in all his thinking. He should sit with his team for as much of the innings as possible. In short, the Captain on one hand must be a good tactician, a leader of men, well-versed in the game, courteous, capable to acknowledge efforts of his team mates, have a capacity to asses the strengths and weaknesses of his players, decisive, amiable, and responsible with a mature attitude. And on the other hand, have the ability to combine the roles of an effective PR Officer, psychiatrist, accountant, nursemaid and, above all, a diplomat par excellence! <br><br><em>-- Vikram Kaul</em><br></p>
